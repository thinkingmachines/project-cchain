#### *Linking Village-Level Data on Climatic Impact-Drivers, Socioeconomic Vulnerability, and Environmental Conditions to Health Impacts across 12 Philippine Cities*
</br>
</br>
The **Project CCHAIN dataset** is a validated, open-sourced linked dataset containing 20 years (2003-2022) of health, climate, environment, and socioeconomic variables at the barangay (village) level across 12 Philippine cities. 

This work was carried out with the aid of a grant from [Lacuna Fund](https://lacunafund.org/), an initiative co-founded by [The Rockefeller Foundation](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/), [Google.org](https://google.org), [Canadaâ€™s International Development Research Centre](https://www.idrc-crdi.ca/en), and [GIZ](https://www.giz.de/en/html/index.html) on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ); and [Wellcome](https://wellcome.org/).
