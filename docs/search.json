    "text": "The Philippines is among the world’s most vulnerable countries to climate change – simultaneously exposed to typhoons, sea level rise, and extreme heat, while striving to address income inequality and rising disease burdens.\nWhile there is growing interest in modeling the health impacts of climate change in the country, significant data workflow logistics and multi-disciplinary expertise is required to assemble and process health, climate, and socioeconomic data from diverse sources, formats, geographic and historical coverage and resolutions.\nMoreover, focusing on the barangay, the smallest administrative unit in the Philippines, helps disaggregate health risks for vulnerable communities, particularly those in informal settlements, and provides actionable insights for local governments. In addition, creating a small yet sufficient elements-at-risk dataset for settlements with useful attributes can aid in generating even more detailed data at the community level.\nThe project team aims to ease entry and encourage more studies in the field by doing all the needed work in assembling the Project CCHAIN dataset.\nIt is our hope that this endeavor can promote investments in the creation of more open and analysis-ready datasets.\n\n\nWe selected 12 key cities with a variety of geographic, socioeconomic, and climatological conditions. All in all, a total of 744 baranggays are covered by the dataset.\n\n\n\n\nThinking Machines Data Science, Inc. (TM) is a Southeast Asian technology consultancy that builds custom AI and data platforms to help organizations make smarter decisions with data.
