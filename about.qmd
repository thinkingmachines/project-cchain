# The Problem

The Philippines is among the world’s most vulnerable countries to climate change – simultaneously exposed to typhoons, sea level rise, and extreme heat, while striving to address income inequality and rising disease burdens. 

While there is growing interest in modeling the health impacts of climate change in the country, the lack of freely-accessible data remains a significant barrier to progress.

1. Significant data workflow logistics and multi-disciplinary expertise is required to assemble and process health, climate, and socioeconomic data from diverse sources, formats, geographic and historical coverage and resolutions. 

2. Limited available datasets at the barangay level, the smallest administrative unit in the Philippines, hinders the policy makers to make impactful health interventions, especially for vulnerable communities. 

 With the support of the [Lacuna Fund](https://lacunafund.org/) and [Wellcome Trust](https://wellcome.org/), the project team aims to ease entry and encourage more studies in the field by doing all the needed work in assembling an open dataset of climate, environmental, socioeconomic, and health variables.

It is our hope that this endeavor can promote investments in the creation of more open and analysis-ready datasets.

## Geographical Coverage 

We selected **12 key cities** with a variety of geographic, socioeconomic, and climatological conditions. All in all, a total of **744** baranggays are covered by the dataset.
