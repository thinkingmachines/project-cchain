# 📜 Description

The Lacuna Fund Climate x Health project aims to develop a dataset that links health data to climate, environmental conditions, and socioeconomic vulnerabilities that spans 20 years along with a baseline ML model for 12 target cities in the Philippines.  

We aim to open source the linked dataset and the baseline ML model in order for more research to be developed on the impact of environmental and societal conditions to health and to further create better policies on for communities. 

# 🗄 File Organization

## Data Directory

1. `01-admin-bounds` - official administrative boundaries for the target areas
2. `02-raw` - subdivided further per partner and data source
3. `03-processed` - subdivided further per partner and data source
4. `04-output` - final tables that would be used for the linked dataset
5. `05-gis` - map plots

## Notebooks

Directory is divided based on each organization/partner in this project.

# ⚙️ Local Setup for Development

This repo assumes the use of [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) for simplicity in installing GDAL.


## Requirements

1. Python 3.9
2. make
3. conda


## 🐍 One-time Set-up
Run this the very first time you are setting-up the project on a machine to set-up a local Python environment for this project.

1. Install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) for your environment if you don't have it yet.
```bash
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

2. Create a local conda env and activate it. This will create a conda env folder in your project directory.
```
make conda-env
conda activate <env name>
```

3. Run the one-time set-up make command.
```
make setup
```

## 🐍 Testing
To run automated tests, simply run `make test`.

## 📦 Dependencies

Over the course of development, you will likely introduce new library dependencies. This repo uses [pip-tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools) to manage the python dependencies.

There are two main files involved:
* `requirements.in` - contains high level requirements; this is what we should edit when adding/removing libraries
* `requirements.txt` - contains exact list of python libraries (including depdenencies of the main libraries) your environment needs to follow to run the repo code; compiled from `requirements.in`


When you add new python libs, please do the ff:

1. Add the library to the `requirements.in` file. You may optionally pin the version if you need a particular version of the library.

2. Run `make requirements` to compile a new version of the `requirements.txt` file and update your python env.

3. Commit both the `requirements.in` and `requirements.txt` files so other devs can get the updated list of project requirements.

Note: When you are the one updating your python env to follow library changes from other devs (reflected through an updated `requirements.txt` file), simply run `pip-sync requirements.txt`
